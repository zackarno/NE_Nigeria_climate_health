## Overview of Data

-   Below is a graph showing:
    -   precipitation
    -   surface soil moisture
    -   sub-surface soil moisture
    -   AWD cases/100

## Establishing Environmental Thresholds

-   A prominent peak occurs shortly after the start of the rainy season.
-   Rainfall generally declines after this initial peak
-   Below we have graphed cumulative yearly rainfall against AWD
    caseload
    -   we see that AWD caseloads tend to peak in a narrow band of
        cumulative rainfall
